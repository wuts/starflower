<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>PyroCMS is now installed and ready to go! Please log into the admin panel with the following details.</p>

</p>

<p>As soon as you log in, create yourself a new user, log out and back in with your new account. Then delete this default account.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>delete the installer from your server</strong> as if you leave it here it can be used to hack your website.</p>
